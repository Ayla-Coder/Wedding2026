    <p>Thomas and I are already very lucky to be where we are in life, with a house of our own to live in! While functional, 
        the house unfortunately needs some repairs and upgrades, especially since we're thinking of starting a family soon. We 
        appreciate any amount you would like to give, especially since we don't want our family and friends to feel pressured into 
        gifting us anything. We're just happy to share our special day with you!
    </p>

    <h2>Amount raised:</h2>
    <p>I will update this as often as I can if you are curious about the total amount!</p>
    <p>**last updated**</p>
    <h2>Donation options</h2>
    <p>You can either transfer the money directly to our bank account, pay us in cash (preferably Norwegian kroner)
        or use Paypal or Vipps. We would prefer digital, but we'll make whatever is easiest for you work. 
    </p>
