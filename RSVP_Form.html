                <p>Remember that we will ask that you pay a small sum of money to cover some of the cost of hiring the bus. We will keep this under
                    the price of hiring a taxi, which are notoriously expensive in Norway, though this is always an option. As for payment options, 
                    I'll set that up on the website asap. 

                    Again, we aren't 100% sure about the times for the bus yet, or if we'll hire one for both pick-up and drop-off. It all depends on 
                    the amount of people who want/need to take the bus. All of this info will be posted to the website as soon as we know more.</p>

                <p>Due to limited space and to save time (and because of the alcohol-serving laws in Norway), instead of having a normal bar
                    set-up we have to use drink-vouchers. These will be sold in packs of three on our website, and will be purchaseable using 
                    Vipps (Norway), Paypal and bank transfers. We ask that you buy these in advance, both to save time and so that we get a 
                    good idea of how many vouchers we will need and how many drinks we will need to provide. we will also set things up so that 
                    you can purchase some on-site as a last resort.<b>We will of course cover the welcome-drinks and wine with dinner.</b>

                        We are currently working on a drink menu that we will post to the website at some point. What we do know so far, is that 
                        we want to provide exciting mixed drinks with equally exciting <i>alcohol-free</i> versions! <br> <br>
                        Again, we haven't landed on the exact menu yet, but we know we want to serve pi√±a coladas and margaritas made in a slushie 
                        machine, as well as beer, wine and maybe some home-brewed hard cider and beer too.
