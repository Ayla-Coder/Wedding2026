<h1>Ayla and Thomas</h1>
<h2>16 May 2026</h2>

<p> Welcome to our special day! </p>
<p> We hope you can make it! We decided to make a decentralized website with detailed info so that everyone can access 
  this information easily, without needing a facebook account. Now that we've started sending out official invites, we'd like to inform everyone 
  that we will need an RSVP by the end of this December (2025) at the latest. If we don't recieve a confirmation of your attendance by then, then we will 
  assume you cannot make it and will not include you on our guest list. :( </p> 
  
  <p> We will keep updating this website whenever we have time and when 
  we get new info!</p>

<h3>This website is currently still unfinished!</h3>

<p>Don't be surprised if things don't work yet. Please bear with me as I (Ayla) learn html! Some links may not work yet and it is currently not possible to rsvp 
  on this website yet. This will be implemented asap. In the meantime, if you have any questions, feel free to contact either me or Thomas 
individually or via our shared email address codergulbrandsen@gmail.com </p>

<h3>Dress Code</h3>
<p>We decided to go with a blend of cocktail-style and formal ballgown/medieval style. For reference, this is what the bridemaids will be wearing: </p>

</center>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Busses and transport options</h3>
<p>As mentioned in the invitation, we are thinking of ordering two busses, one that will leave earlier 
    in the evening and one that will leave at the end of the night. We are not sure how much this will 
    cost us yet, as the size of the busses will depend on how many people want to take it. We will ask for a 
    small contribution to cover the cost when we know more, but rest assured this won't be an extravagant amount of 
    money per person. We will aim for under 200 kr (20 USD) per person.</p>
