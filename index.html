<h2>16 May 2026</h2> <br><br><br>
<p> Welcome to our special day! </p>
<p> We hope you can make it! We decided to make a decentralized website with detailed info so that everyone can access 
  this information easily, without needing a facebook account. </p> 
  
  <p> We will keep updating this website whenever we have time and when 
  we get new info!</p>

<h4>Sign up here to get emails when the website is updated with important info!</h4>

  This is a long time coming! We honestly didn't really want to ask for anything, becuase we know that just going to a wedding (especially overseas)
  is a gift to us in and of itself. But several people have asked for this already, so we worked on something for those of you who would still like to
  get something. We hope this doesn't come too late or is too stressful. <br><br><br>

     <h4>Renovation funds option</h4>
    <p>For anyone who would rather not buy a physical gift, we also have a fundraiser option where you can donate any amount you feel like towards renovating
    our house! You can find that link either through the registry, or here: </p>

<h4>This website is currently still unfinished!</h4>

<p>Don't be surprised if things don't work yet. Please bear with me as I (Ayla) learn html! Some links may not work yet. 
  If you have any questions, feel free to contact either me or Thomas individually or via our shared email address codergulbrandsen@gmail.com </p>

<div class="content">
  <p>Cocktail attire, formal gowns, bunad or whatever formal dresses you are most comfortable in are all welcome!</p>
<p><h4>No need to purchase anything new! Examples are provided only as <i>inspiration</i>.</h4> <br> The groom and groomsmen will be wearing suits and tuxedos with vests 
  like the example below. The bride is going for a slightly more fantasy-styled dress. For reference, the dresses in images below are similar to what the bridemaids 
  will be wearing. Romantic or fantasy-inspired elements are <i>optional</i>, not expected. These include things like necklaces, rings or cool cufflinks. 
  <br><br>
  <h4>Please don't bring any swords!!!</h4></p>
<p></p>

<h3>Weather</h3>
The wedding ceremony is to take place outside, with an indoor option available in case of unfavourable weather. Please note that the venue is a converted barn and 
although it is heated, <h4>it would be wise to take a cardigan (sweater)/jacket/shawl and check the weather just in case.</h4></p> <br>

  <h4>6 Feb. 2026 Update!:</h4> <br>

<p>We have ordered a bus for pickup around 13:30, and drop off between 22:30, and 01:30. </p>

<p>We have decided to not charge for the bus or the drinks. The logistics were too complicated. Guests who wish to contribute toward 
  the Buss an drinks may do so via Vipps or PayPal on the day, we will put up a poster with info 🙂. Contributions are completely optional 
  and very much appreciated.</p> <br>

<h3>Other transport options: </h3> <br>
<p>Taxis tend to be expensive, so it's best to agree on a fixed price or get an estimate beforehand. Alternatively, services 
  like Uber or Bolt often offer more affordable options.</p><br><br>
<h3>Parking at the venue:</h3><br>
<p>There is somewhat limeted parking at the venue, but this is an option if you would prefere to drive. Please carpool if at all posible. </p>

  <p>To anyone who hasn't answered via our digital RSVP: Please let us know either via email or text where you will be staying so that 
    we can coordinate pickup  spots. The driver said he can pick people up from both Larvik and Sandefjord.

<button type="button" class="collapsible"><h3><img src="images/Cutlery_transparent.png" alt="Cutlery icon" width="57.2" height="70"/>Food Menu (click) </h3></button>
<div class="content">
We have an idea of what the menu is going to be like, but we haven't made a final decision yet. We want to include some classic Norwegian elements to give everyone a little
taste of Norway. The suggestions from the chef so far include: <br><br>

<h4>Hors d'oeuvres (Thomas calls this fingerfood)</h4>
- Lefser with fresh cheese, arugula salad and reindeer sausage.<br>
- Fruit platter<br>
- Popcorn machine<br><br>

<h4>Starter</h4>
Creamy green asparagus soup, served with lightly whipped crème fraîche with lemon, parmesan, emulsion, lightly toasted bread croutons, 
Parma ham, chili oil and fresh cress. <br><br>

<h4>Main course</h4>
Long-roasted beef tenderloin 56c, served with pickled red onion with raspberry vinegar, cauliflower cream, homemade chimichurri (or green pepper sauce), 
garlic reduction, lightly grilled heart lettuce and small potatoes with fresh herbs.<br><br>

<h4>Dessert</h4>
We haven't decided this yet ;)<br><br>

<div class="content">
  <p><i>Author: Luoise C. Gulbrandsen (mother of the groom)</i></p>
<p>Here is some practical information for our guests. The ceremony, reception and evening party are all to be held at Asparagus Gården www.Aspargesgården.no. 
   NB. The wedding ceremony is to take place outside, with an indoor option available in case of unfavourable weather.  
   Please note that the venue is a converted barn and although it is heated, it would be wise to take a cardigan / jacket / shawl just in case. </p>
  <h4>1. Where is it and how to get there </h4>
  <p>Aspargesgården  <br> Østbyveien 75, <br> 3280 Tjodalyng </p>
  <center><img src="images/Larvik_kart 2.png" alt="Map of Larvik and the surrounding area" witdth="auto" max-width="100%" height="394.6"></center>
  <ul>
    <li>The nearest airport to the venue is Torp Airport, 25 minutes away from the venue by car. Shuttle busses from Torp airport run to Sandefjord.</li><br>
    <li>You can of course fly to Oslo airport if you would like to do some sightseeing in Oslo first. Jan, Louise, Daniel, Thomas, Ayla and Eva and Rod all live less 
      than an hour from Oslo airport. Oslo airport is 2 ½ hours from the venue by car. You can also catch a train from Oslo airport to the nearest town; Larvik 
      or to Sandefjord</li><br>
    <li>Larvik town (and railway station) is 12 minutes away from the venue by car.</li><br>
    <li>Sandefjord town (and railway station) is 25 minutes away from the venue by car</li><br>
  </ul>

<h4>2. Where to stay</h4>
<p>There is no on-site accommodation at the venue. The nearest hotels are in Larvik, about 12–15 minutes away by car, and Sandefjord, about 25–30 minutes away. 
  You may find an Airbnb closer but we have not located any so far. You can explore accommodations in Larvik and Sandefjord using platforms such as www.booking.com. 
  Most establishments have yet to release their rates for this period. Currently available prices start at GBP 95 per night for a double room for 2 adults.</p>

<p>Thomas and Ayla are planning to offer a free bus service to/from Larvik – details to come but the bus will probably run to a couple of places in Larvik town 
  centre. Check Thomas and Ayla’s web page for details.</p>

<p>We have contacted several hotels to inquire about potential discounts for guests booking at the same location. We will let you know if we get a positive answer.</p><br>

<h4>3. Wheather and Climate</h4>

<p>The month of May in Norway is unpredictable; it can feel like summer or winter. While snow is unlikely, temperatures can soar to 25°C with sunny skies or drop 
close to freezing with rain and chilly weather. The climate data below provides an overview for the area in May. In recent years, the month has been quite warm, so 
let’s hope for the best! Check the forecast as your trip approaches and pack accordingly. Remember that the wedding ceremony is to take place outside, with an indoor 
option available in case of unfavourable weather. Weather service online: www.yr.no.

<br><br>
<h4>4. Other useful information</h4>
<ul>
  <li>You can use credit cards everywhere in Norway so you will probably not need cash at all. On busses and other public transport, you will need to download 
    an app for the best prices as cash / card are priced at a premium. Ask us if you need help.</li><br>

  <li>Taxis tend to be expensive, so it's best to agree on a fixed price or get an estimate beforehand. Alternatively, services like Uber or Bolt often 
    offer more affordable options.</li><br>

  <li>Thursday 14th May (Ascension Day) is a bank holiday in Norway</li><br>

  <li>Most stores (including grocery stores) tend to be closed on bank holidays. Get what you need beforehand! Or go to the slightly more expensive shops like 
    Joker that stay open every day of the year.
  </li><br>

  <li>Sunday 17th May marks Norway’s National Day, celebrated with children's parades, music, and festivities across the country, usually in the morning. 
    Many Norwegians wear traditional national costumes, so we highly recommend staying an extra half a day to experience the celebrations rather than travelling 
    home on Sunday morning. Whether in Larvik, Sandefjord, or another town, it's a great opportunity to see a special tradition.
