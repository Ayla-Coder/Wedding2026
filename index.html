<h1>Ayla and Thomas</h1>
<h2>16 May 2026</h2> <br><br><br>
<p> Welcome to our special day! </p>
<p> We hope you can make it! We decided to make a decentralized website with detailed info so that everyone can access 
  this information easily, without needing a facebook account. </p> 
  
  <p> We will keep updating this website whenever we have time and when 
  we get new info!</p>
<fieldset>
  <center><i>last update: February 6 2026</i> </center>

<h4>Sign up here to get emails when the website is updated with important info!</h4>

<form>

  This is a long time coming! We honestly didn't really want to ask for anything, becuase we know that just going to a wedding (especially overseas)
  is a gift to us in and of itself. But several people have asked for this already, so we worked on something for those of you who would still like to
  get something. We hope this doesn't come too late or is too stressful. 
</fieldset> <br> <br>

<h4>This website is currently still unfinished!</h4>

<p>Don't be surprised if things don't work yet. Please bear with me as I (Ayla) learn html! Some links may not work yet. 
  If you have any questions, feel free to contact either me or Thomas individually or via our shared email address codergulbrandsen@gmail.com </p>

<div class="content">
  <h4>You are not be expected to buy anything new for the dress code! We just wanted to give examples of the theme in case 
  you <i>want</i> to wear anything like this </h4>
<p>We decided to go with a blend of cocktail-style and formal ballgown/medieval style. For reference, this is similar to what the bridemaids will be wearing: </p>

<div class="content">
We have ordered three busses, one for pickup between 12:00 pm and 01:00 pm (12:00 and 13:00) and two for drop off after the party. 
  one of these will leave earlier in the evening around 10:30 pm (22:30), and the other will leave at the end of the night (01:00 am).
  <h4>6 Feb. 2026 Update!:</h4>
  <p>We have decided to not charge for the bus or the drinks. The logistics were too complicated. To anyone who hasn't answered via our digital RSVP:
    Please let us know either via email or text which bus you want to take (what times) and also where you will be staying. The driver said he can pick people 
    up from both Larvik and Sandefjord.

<div class="content">
<p>As mentioned above, we have decided to not charge for our drinks. This means that drink vouchers are no longer necessary! The bar is now open. 
  We will send an update to the website when we have figured the drink menu out. So far, we have purchased the wine and beer:</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible"><h3><img src="images/Cutlery_transparent.png" alt="Cutlery icon" width="57.2" height="70"/>Food Menu (click) </h3></button>
<div class="content">
We have an idea of what the menu is going to be like, but we haven't made a final decision yet. We want to include some classic Norwegian elements to give everyone a little
taste of Norway. The suggestions from the chef so far include: <br><br>

<h4>Hors d'oeuvres (Thomas calls this fingerfood)</h4>
- Lefser with fresh cheese, arugula salad and reindeer sausage.<br>
- Fruit platter<br>
- Popcorn machine<br><br>

<h4>Starter</h4>
Creamy green asparagus soup, served with lightly whipped crème fraîche with lemon, parmesan, emulsion, lightly toasted bread croutons, 
Parma ham, chili oil and fresh cress. <br><br>

<h4>Main course</h4>
Long-roasted beef tenderloin 56c, served with pickled red onion with raspberry vinegar, cauliflower cream, homemade chimichurri (or green pepper sauce), 
garlic reduction, lightly grilled heart lettuce and small potatoes with fresh herbs.<br><br>

<h4>Dessert</h4>
We haven't decided this yet ;)<br><br>
