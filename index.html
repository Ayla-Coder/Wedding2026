<h1>Ayla and Thomas</h1>
<h2>16 May 2026</h2>

<p> Welcome to our special day! </p>
<p> We hope you can make it! We decided to make a decentralized website with detailed info so that everyone can access this information easily, without needing a facebook account. We will keep updating this website whenever we have time and when we get new info.</p>

<h3>Dress Code</h3>
<p>We decided to go with a blend of cocktail-style and formal ballgown/medieval style. For reference, this is what the bridemaids will be wearing: </p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Busses and transport options</h3>
<p>As mentioned in the invitation, we are thinking of ordering two busses, one that will leave earlier in the evening and one that will leave at the end of the night. We are not sure how much this will cost us yet, as the size of the busses will depend on how many people want to take it. We will ask for a small contribution to cover the cost when we know more, but rest assured this won't be an extravagant amount of money per person. We will aim for under 200 kr (20 USD) per person.</p>
